Hello there, 

Here is a fun 3d realm, while also being a DAPP made for the HTM 3.0 Hackathon. I wish for this to be a lightouse to all in the data seas. 

Lighthouse is used here to store data in a decentralized way. I have stored the main file of the app via Lighthouse and IFPS, and I have enabled relaying of information stored on Lighthouse and IFPS, namely, a song that can be played via a secret button in the UI. #HTM3.0 #Hackathon #Lighthouse #Data #Decentralized #3d #Realm
